Sonic Escribe
=============

Sonic Escribe ("_Sonic writes_", in Spanish), is a project I made in [Director](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Director) back in 2006 for a multimedia class. It's based on an old DOS game, [Mario Teaches Typing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_games_in_the_Mario_series#Mario_Teaches_Typing) (included in `/recursos/mariott`), in which basically you have to type fast to score points. My project takes [Sonic the Hedgehog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28character%29) as the hero, and works like one of those old side-scrollers.

What was interesting for me was composing the "scene" from different layers (background objects like clouds, foreground stuff, the actual character), and making it all look like it's one world. For the background, this involves placing a lot of different graphics beside each other, and moving them all at once, at a different speed than the foreground elements.

Almost all the graphics and most of the sounds were painstakingly cut from an actual Sonic the Hedgehog game. The different animations for the character were recreated from single frames in the captured video. I included all the files that were involved in creating this thing.

Other graphics were created in [Fireworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Fireworks), and other sounds taken from God knows where...
